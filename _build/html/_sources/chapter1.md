## Limitation

These methods are typically used to report absolute risk estimates for groups (exposed vs. control) in observational and interventional studies. But for purposes of informed consent, they fall short of the mark unless the individuals risk profile is synonymous with the groups risk profile.

For more on this, see [the MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html).

## Opportunities

Semiparametric methods are used to report relative risk estimates for groups compared with a reference group. They add a layer of complexity in a multivariable context, but also remain limited to scientific inferences. For purposes of informed consent in a specific clinical scenario, a **webApp for personalized** risk is the way forward.

[PMAP](https://pm.jh.edu) is once such approach:

Johns Hopkins Precision Medicine Analytics Platform (PMAP)

Let's compare the two approaches discussed thus far: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.

## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
